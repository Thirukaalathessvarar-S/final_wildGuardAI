The alert instantly appears on EcoSphere’s map.
A nearby volunteer joins the case room, uploads live camera feed.
Vet joins remotely, adds treatment steps


 AlertService now broadcasts alerts, completing the real-time alert system's backend. I'll inform the user that the
  backend is ready and explain how to test it: create an alert via a POST to /api/alerts, and a message will be sent
  to the /topic/alerts WebSocket topic. They can use a WebSocket client to subscribe to /topic/alerts and see the
  alert data pushed in real-time. I won't run the app myself, just provide the testing info.I have now implemented
  the real-time alert system on the backend.


Here's how it works:

   1. When you create a new alert by sending a POST request to /api/alerts, the backend will now also broadcast that
      alert to a WebSocket topic named /topic/alerts.
   2. To test this, you can use a WebSocket client (Postman has one, or you can use a simple online tool) to connect
      to the backend's WebSocket endpoint and subscribe to the /topic/alerts topic.
