            <p class="no-indent"><span class="abstract-title">Abstract—</span><span class="abstract-content">Wildlife rescue operations depend heavily on quick, coordinated responses where even minutes can mean the difference between life and death for injured animals. We've developed WildGuard, a web platform that brings together rescue coordinators, veterinarians, and field teams through streamlined communication and case tracking. Built with Spring Boot on the backend and React for the user interface, the system uses WebSocket technology to keep everyone's information synchronized in real time. What makes our approach interesting is the addition of three AI-driven features we're proposing: automatic summarization of veterinary reports so coordinators can grasp key points quickly, predictive analytics that spots where rescue incidents are likely to happen based on past patterns, and image recognition that helps identify species automatically. These tools aim to lighten the mental load on rescue teams, help deploy resources more strategically, and speed up critical decisions when animals need help urgently. In this paper, we walk through how the current system works, explain our planned AI additions, and explore what difference they could make for wildlife rescue efforts.</span></p>

            <div class="section-title">I. Introduction</div>
            <p>Anyone who's worked in wildlife rescue knows the chaos that can ensue when an emergency call comes in. Traditional communication methods—phone tags, scattered text messages, email chains—create a frustrating mess of information silos. Response times suffer, and animals pay the price. That's the problem we set out to solve with WildGuard.</p>
            <p>Our platform puts everything in one place: a real-time map showing where incidents are happening, who's handling each case, and what the current status is. Each rescue case gets its own dedicated chat room where everyone involved can share updates, photos, and questions without losing track of the conversation. It's already helping teams coordinate better, but we noticed something: the people using it are still working incredibly hard, reading through pages of veterinary notes, trying to spot patterns in where incidents occur, and second-guessing their species identifications under pressure.</p>
            <p>That's where AI comes in. We're not trying to replace human judgment—far from it. Instead, we want to give rescue teams intelligent tools that handle the tedious stuff so they can focus on what matters: saving animals. Here's what we're bringing to the table:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A working real-time coordination platform that's already making a difference in how rescue operations run.</li>
                <li>Three practical AI features designed around real problems we've observed: condensing medical reports into actionable summaries, predicting where future incidents might cluster, and suggesting species identifications from uploaded photos.</li>
                <li>A realistic implementation plan that addresses the practical challenges—from data security to what happens when the AI gets it wrong.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="section-title">II. Related Work</div>
            <p>Emergency response systems have been using real-time messaging for years now, and there's good reason why. When seconds count, publish-subscribe patterns and incident-specific communication channels cut through the noise. The conservation technology world has gotten pretty sophisticated too, with machine learning models monitoring wildlife, detecting poaching activity, and forecasting ecological trends. But here's what we've noticed: you usually get platforms that are either great at crunching data but terrible at workflow, or excellent at managing operations but lacking in analytical depth. Nobody's really bridged that gap effectively yet, and that's where WildGuard fits in—we're building the analytics directly into the workflow instead of treating them as separate systems.</p>
            <p>There's been interesting work lately on using large language models to summarize medical texts, which cuts down on the time doctors and nurses spend reading lengthy reports. Meanwhile, hotspot prediction—figuring out where problems are likely to pop up next—has proven valuable in everything from crime prevention to disease outbreak tracking. We're adapting these same approaches for wildlife incidents, which follow their own seasonal rhythms and habitat patterns. For identifying animals from photos, pretrained vision models and fine-tuned neural networks work remarkably well, especially when you narrow them down to species found in specific regions. We're not claiming to have invented new algorithms here; our contribution is making these existing technologies actually useful for people working in the field.</p>

            <div class="section-title">III. Literature Review 1: Real-Time Systems and Coordination Platforms</div>
            <p>WildGuard's foundation rests on some well-established ideas from emergency response technology and modern web development. We're using WebSockets with STOMP protocol over SockJS, which sounds technical but essentially means information flows between team members with minimal delay—something that's been proven effective in emergency contexts [1]. When you're dealing with an injured animal, every minute matters, so keeping everyone's view of the situation synchronized isn't just convenient, it's critical.</p>
            <p>We went with Spring Boot for the server side and React for the interface, which might sound like standard tech stack choices, and honestly, they are. But that's exactly the point. These frameworks are battle-tested for building applications that need to handle lots of simultaneous users and real-time data while still being maintainable over the long haul [3]. The idea of giving each rescue case its own collaborative space, overlaid on a map showing where everything's happening, mirrors patterns used successfully in various incident management systems [6]. By centralizing everything in one place, we're directly tackling the scattered information problem that plagues traditional rescue coordination.</p>

            <div class="section-title">IV. Literature Review 2: Conservation AI and Intelligent Assistance</div>
            <p>The AI features we're proposing for WildGuard draw from a growing field called Conservation AI, where researchers are applying machine learning to help solve ecological problems [2], [4].</p>
            <p><strong>Automated Species Identification:</strong> Using computer vision to identify species from photos has become a hot research area in conservation technology. Studies show that both off-the-shelf vision APIs and models trained on specific regional species can nail identifications with impressive accuracy [7], [8], [9]. We're building this right into the case creation process so that what used to be a manual, sometimes error-prone step becomes semi-automated. What's clever about our approach is tracking when humans override the AI's suggestions—these corrections become training data for improving the model later, creating what researchers call a Human-in-the-Loop system [15], [16]. It's about building trust in the technology while continuously making it smarter.</p>
            <p><strong>Predictive Hotspot Analysis:</strong> The idea of forecasting where incidents will happen using spatiotemporal data isn't new—urban planners and epidemiologists have been doing it for years [10]. We're applying similar techniques like density clustering and regression models to wildlife rescue data, which has its own patterns tied to seasons and habitats [11]. This shifts rescue operations from constantly reacting to problems toward anticipating them, getting resources positioned before incidents happen. That proactive approach can dramatically cut response times, which directly impacts whether animals survive.</p>
            <p><strong>Medical Text Summarization:</strong> The LLM-powered summarization feature addresses a real pain point: veterinary reports can be dense with clinical terminology that coordinators need to understand quickly but aren't trained to interpret [12], [13], [14]. Recent work in biomedical natural language processing has shown these models can distill complex medical documents into clear, actionable summaries. By automatically generating three key takeaways in plain language from each vet report, we're reducing the cognitive load on coordinators so they can focus on logistics rather than parsing medical jargon.</p>

            <div class="section-title">V. Literature Summary</div>
            <p>Looking across the research, it's clear WildGuard is pulling together two complementary technology areas that don't often meet: real-time coordination systems and embedded AI. The platform's technical backbone—Spring Boot, React, WebSockets—follows proven patterns for low-latency emergency response (References [1], [3]). What makes our work distinct is how we're weaving analytical capabilities directly into the operational workflow instead of keeping them separate. The species identification and hotspot prediction features leverage validated Conservation AI methods (References [7], [10]) but adapt them specifically for rapid field deployment and proactive resource planning. The medical summarization feature taps into recent Clinical NLP advances (References [12], [14]) to dramatically lighten the cognitive burden on rescue personnel. Essentially, we're transforming WildGuard from just a communication tool into an intelligent assistant that helps teams make faster, better-informed decisions when it matters most.</p>

            <div class="section-title">VI. System Architecture</div>
            <p>WildGuard follows a clean client-server setup with distinct responsibilities on each side, which makes it easier to scale as usage grows. We've included some diagrams to show how the pieces fit together and how data flows through the system.</p>
            
            <div class="figure-container">
                <img src="../7240924b-17c9-4664-a93e-bfc3ae52b63b.png" alt="System Architecture Diagram">
                <p>figure 1.1 architecture diagram</p>
            </div>

            <div class="subsection-title">A. Backend Architecture</div>
            <p>The server side is built as a single cohesive application using Spring Boot and Java. It handles standard database operations through a REST API and manages real-time updates via WebSocket connections. While we could have gone with a microservices approach, the monolithic structure keeps operations simpler at our current scale. We've organized the code into clear modules (cases, users, chat, files) so we can break things apart later if needed.</p>
            <p><strong>Framework:</strong> We're running Spring Boot 3.3.x with Maven, utilizing Spring Web for HTTP handling, Spring Data JPA for database operations, Spring Security for access control, and WebSocket/STOMP for real-time messaging.</p>
            <p><strong>Core Components:</strong> Controllers receive incoming requests and route them to appropriate services. Services handle the actual business logic—managing case lifecycles, coordinating different user roles (coordinators, vets, responders), and moderating chat conversations. Repositories interact with our PostgreSQL database, managing relationships between Cases, Users, Chat Messages, and file Attachments.</p>
            <p><strong>Real-Time Communication:</strong> For live updates, we're using WebSockets with STOMP protocol over SockJS, which provides reliability and automatic fallback when WebSocket connections aren't available. Each case gets its own topic channel (like <code>/topic/case/{id}</code>), and we control who can subscribe based on their role. When something important happens—a new case, a status change, a chat message—the server pushes that update to everyone who's subscribed, with guarantees that messages are delivered at least once.</p>
            <p><strong>Security & Privacy:</strong> Authentication works through JWT tokens with refresh capabilities; authorization is role-based with method-level protection. We're careful with file uploads, checking types and sizes, storing files with signed URLs, and scrubbing sensitive information before sending anything to AI services. We also maintain audit logs to track sensitive actions, which is crucial for accountability.</p>
            <p><strong>Scalability & Reliability:</strong> Our API servers are stateless and sit behind a load balancer for distribution. The database is optimized with indexes on geographic and time-based fields since those queries are common. We're caching frequently accessed data like case lists and hotspot map tiles to reduce database load. To prevent problems where slow clients bog down the system, we've implemented backpressure handling on WebSocket broadcasts.</p>
            
            <div class="subsection-title">B. Frontend Architecture</div>
            <p>The user interface is a React-based single-page app that provides a responsive experience whether someone's in the office or out in the field on a mobile device. We've designed it to handle spotty connections gracefully, which is pretty common in remote wildlife areas.</p>
            <p><strong>Framework:</strong> Built with React using Create React App (or a similar modern bundler).</p>
            <p><strong>Core Components:</strong> We've created reusable components for common interface elements: case lists, detail panels, assignment controls, and the per-case chat interface. Map views show where incidents are happening and overlay hotspot predictions when available.</p>
            <p><strong>State Management:</strong> We're using React hooks for managing component-level state, plus query libraries (or custom hooks) to keep server data fresh. When WebSocket events come in, we automatically invalidate stale cached data so users always see current information.</p>
            <p><strong>API Communication:</strong> Initial data fetches and user actions go through REST endpoints; ongoing updates stream through WebSockets (using the <code>@stomp/stompjs</code> library). We've built in exponential backoff and heartbeat detection to handle unreliable network connections better.</p>
            <p><strong>UX Considerations:</strong> Forms are designed to minimize cognitive load through progressive disclosure—showing options only when they're relevant. We've paid attention to accessibility with keyboard navigation and proper ARIA labels. Error notifications use toast messages, and we employ optimistic UI updates to keep workflows smooth even when connectivity is intermittent.</p>

            <div class="section-title">VII. Proposed AI-Powered Enhancements</div>
            <p>We're integrating AI specifically where it can save people time and help them act faster: turning lengthy clinical reports into quick summaries, predicting where incidents are likely to occur next, and speeding up species identification.</p>
            
            <div class="subsection-title">A. AI-Powered Medical Report Summarization</div>
            <p>Veterinary reports can run several pages and contain specialized medical terminology. Coordinators don't need to understand every clinical detail—they need to know what happened, how serious it is, and what actions are needed. That's what the AI Summary feature does.</p>
            <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> When someone uploads a report (either text file or PDF), our backend extracts the text (using OCR if needed) and sends it to a secure LLM API like GPT or Gemini with carefully crafted instructions and safety constraints.</p>
            <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> The FileStorageService triggers the AISummaryService after the file is safely stored. We send a specific prompt to the AI: "Summarize the following veterinary report into three key bullet points for a non-medical coordinator. Include diagnosis, severity, and immediate actions."</p>
            <p><strong>Safety & Compliance:</strong> Before sending anything to the AI, we strip out personally identifiable information and health data that shouldn't leave our system. The prompts are designed to exclude personal identifiers. When the summary comes back, we automatically post it as a system message in the case chat so everyone can see where it came from.</p>
            <p><strong>Fallbacks:</strong> If the AI service is down or returns a low-confidence result (we check based on length and content coverage heuristics), the interface shows the original text with suggested important sections highlighted instead.</p>
            
            <div class="subsection-title">B. Predictive Hotspot Analysis</div>
            <p>Instead of always reacting to incidents after they happen, what if we could anticipate where they're likely to occur? That's the goal of hotspot prediction—it lets teams position resources proactively rather than scrambling after the fact.</p>
            <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> We analyze historical case data—GPS coordinates, timestamps, species involved, and outcomes—aggregating it into spatial and temporal bins. We're testing several approaches: density-based clustering with DBSCAN, kernel density estimation for generating heatmaps, and gradient-boosted regression for risk scoring.</p>
            <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> A scheduled background job (written in Python with pandas and scikit-learn) periodically pulls the latest data, trains updated models, and exports results as map tiles and priority location lists. We version these outputs so we can track how predictions evolve and serve them through a dedicated <code>/hotspots</code> API endpoint.</p>
            <p><strong>Bias & Seasonality:</strong> Wildlife patterns shift with seasons and habitats, so our models incorporate these features explicitly. We use month-blocked cross-validation during training to avoid cheating by testing on adjacent time periods. Importantly, we give coordinators controls to mark false positives and negatives, feeding these corrections back into the next training cycle.</p>
            
            <div class="subsection-title">C. Automated Species Identification</div>
            <p>Getting the species right matters—it determines which specialists get called, what equipment is needed, and what protocols to follow. But identifying species quickly under field conditions can be challenging, especially for less common animals.</p>
            <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> When someone uploads a photo to a new case, our SpeciesIdentificationService sends it to a vision API (like Google Cloud Vision or AWS Rekognition) or a custom-trained classifier. The service returns its top predictions with confidence scores.</p>
            <p><strong>Integration:</strong> We automatically pre-fill the "Animal Type" field with the highest-confidence prediction, but we're not hiding the AI's uncertainty. The interface shows alternative predictions in a dropdown with confidence badges so users can make informed decisions. When someone overrides the AI's suggestion, we log that correction as a weak label for future model training.</p>
            <p><strong>Quality Controls:</strong> We run safety detectors to prevent misuse, filtering out inappropriate content. If a photo contains human faces, we apply blurring or redaction to protect privacy before any processing happens.</p>

            <div class="section-title">VIII. Evaluation</div>
            <p>We're measuring success both in system performance metrics and in actual impact on user workflows, combining offline analysis with field tests.</p>
            <p><strong>Summarization:</strong> We'll run task studies measuring how quickly coordinators can comprehend key information with and without AI summaries. User satisfaction surveys with Likert scales will capture subjective usefulness. Most importantly, we'll track error rates in logistics decisions before and after summaries are available. For reference, we'll also report automatic metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore, though we know these don't tell the whole story.</p>
            <p><strong>Hotspot Prediction:</strong> Using rolling-origin backtesting (training on past data, testing on future periods), we'll measure precision and recall for predicted hotspot zones. We'll also track hit rates—what percentage of new incidents occur within predicted areas—at various threshold settings to find the right balance.</p>
            <p><strong>Species Identification:</strong> We'll report standard accuracy metrics (top-1 and top-3) and calibration quality using Expected Calibration Error. We'll break down performance by challenging conditions like poor lighting or partial occlusion. The rate at which humans override the AI's suggestion serves as a trust proxy—frequent overrides might indicate the model needs improvement or that users don't trust it.</p>
            <p><strong>System KPIs:</strong> From a technical perspective, we're monitoring end-to-end latency (aiming for under 200 milliseconds from case creation to broadcast), WebSocket message delivery success rate (targeting above 99.9%), and frontend load times on low-end devices commonly used in field work.</p>

            <div class="section-title">IX. Conclusion and Future Work</div>
            <p>WildGuard brings wildlife rescue coordination into the modern age by unifying incident management, real-time communication, and intelligent assistance in one platform. The AI features we're proposing tackle genuine pain points we've observed in rescue operations, and we've been thoughtful about building in safeguards for privacy and reliability. Crucially, we've designed the system to work in bandwidth-limited environments because that's the reality of field operations.</p>
            <p>There's more we want to explore down the road. Route optimization that accounts for traffic patterns and terrain challenges would help responders get to incidents faster. Multilingual interfaces and voice input would make the system accessible to more teams and allow hands-free reporting in the field. We're interested in personalizing summaries based on the user's role and expertise level. And we want to build continuous learning pipelines that incorporate operator feedback while preventing model drift over time. We're planning a longer-term study with partner organizations to see how these features affect rescue outcomes in the real world—that's ultimately what matters.</p>
